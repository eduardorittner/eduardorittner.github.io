## Reading List

This is a list of technical articles, blog posts, videos and any other resources that I have learned from.

## Blogs

I read a lot of technical blogs, most of these have an RSS feed

- [cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/blog/) - Very frequent posts on web technologies and programming culture
- [gendignoux](https://gendignoux.com/) - Nice articles on using and optimizing Rust
- [cliffle](https://cliffle.com/) - Posts mostly about embedded stuff, but has some very in-depth Rust posts
- [ochagavia](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/) - Rust posts (yet again) and some other things related to being an independent consultant
- [jeffsmits](https://blog.jeffsmits.net/) - Posts on parsing, grammars and finite automata.
- [samwho](https://samwho.dev/blog/)
- [dan luu](http://danluu.com/)
- [nelhage](https://blog.nelhage.com/)
- [fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/) - Does long-form articles as well as youtube videos. Very high quality content on low-level systems programming.
- [nullprogram](https://nullprogram.com/) - Follow him for his opinions on modern C development practices.
- [Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/archive) - Really like his Joy and Curiosity series.
- [nrk](https://nrk.neocities.org/) - The original inspiration for this site's aesthetics and some good tips on C programming.
- [Ginger Bill](https://www.gingerbill.org/) - Creator of the [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) lang. Opinions on programming language designs, and a nice series on memory allocation patterns.

### Specific posts

- [Learn Rust the Dangerous Way](https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/) - Series on learning Rust by using unsafe Rust to convert a very optimized C program to Rust. This really resonated with me, since I come from coding in C and like having low-level control. I also liked the final plot twist that doing everything in safe Rust was actually faster than both the original C version and the unsafe Rust version.

## Youtube

- [Casey Muratori](https://www.youtube.com/@MollyRocket) - Videos on code performance and optimization.
- [fasterthanlime](https://www.youtube.com/@fasterthanlime) - Videos on how things work, computers, network stacks, program tracing, etc.
-  [NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) - Short videos on Rust, coding, and content creation.
- [Kay Lack](https://www.youtube.com/@neoeno4242) - Regular expressions, grammars, finite automata, assembly, computer science history, it's all there.
- [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo) - High-quality in-depth features on the internals of Rust or specific Rust crates.
