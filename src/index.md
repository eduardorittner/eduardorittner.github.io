# Homepage

This is my personal site where I document things I find interesting, mostly in computer science and programming in general.
I'm currently interested in programming language and compiler design, creative binary file visualizations and operating systems.

#### You can check out:

- [Posts](posts.html) where I generally write longer articles about various topics.

- [Notes](notes.html) where I write small technical notes.

- [Ramblings](ramblings.html) where I write whatever comes to mind whenever.

#### About me:

- [Github](https://github.com/eduardorittner) Is what I use for my personal projects and contributions.

#### Some people I am inspired by:

- [NRK](https://nrk.neocities.org/) - Some nice articles on C and programming. I also think their website is super cool looking.

- [Fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/) - Mostly for his videos, which are super in depth and explore some really cool low level topics in programming.

- [Nullprogram](https://nullprogram.com/) - Specially for some very nice thoughts regarding good practices when programming in C.

- [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/blog/) - Seems like a really passionate guy talking about about programming and its surrounding context.

- [Ginger Bill](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/) - Creator of the Odin programming language, has some nice thougs on programming language design, and a good writeup of different memory allocator strategies.
