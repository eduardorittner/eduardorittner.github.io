      <description>1. Merging unrelated repos You can merge two entirely distinct and independent repos, which can be very useful. Saw this on one of Jon Gjenset&amp;rsquo;s streams where he basically has a repo with some general github actions for CI in rust crates, and whenever he creates a new repo for a crate, he adds the CI repo, merges it and gets all the github actions configured right away. The benefit of this strategy is that if somedat he updates the CI repo, adds some new action or changes an existing one, he can update any repo that uses them by just pulling and merging the changes.</description>

      <description>Here are some commands I don&amp;rsquo;t use all that often but still think are nice to remember just in case I need them:&#xA;watch -n [interval in seconds] [command] It runs the given command periodically (every 2 seconds by default) and prints the whole output to stdout.</description>
