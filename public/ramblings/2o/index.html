<p>Stress runs in my family, and I am definetely guilty of worrying too much, too soon and too often about things. However, things have been looking up and I&rsquo;ve found that lately I&rsquo;ve gotten much better at not worrying unnecesseraly, and just having a good time even on weekdays, I hope that by the time I&rsquo;m 21 I&rsquo;ll have gotten even better at that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not nice to admit it but I&rsquo;ve also been pretty lonely. My girlfriend&rsquo;s been there for me (like always) and my family as well, but I&rsquo;ve grown apart from most of my friends, and have found it difficult to cultivate new friendships. So I hope that 21 year old me will have gotten some new friends (not a lot, just a few good ones) and also spent more time on hobbies far from computers and tech.</p>
<p>Last but not least I hope to be employed as an intern or junior at a nice job, somewhere where the work I do excites me and inspires me to learn more and become better at my craft.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all, life&rsquo;s been hard but it&rsquo;s also been good, and things are looking up I think. Who knows! Happy birthday to me.</p>
