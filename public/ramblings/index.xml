      <description>Basically what the title says, I&amp;rsquo;ve just turned 20 years old, and this is what&amp;rsquo;s on my mind. Stress runs in my family, and I am definetely guilty of worrying too much, too soon and too often about things. However, things have been looking up and I&amp;rsquo;ve found that lately I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten much better at not worrying unnecesseraly, and just having a good time even on weekdays, I hope that by the time I&amp;rsquo;m 21 I&amp;rsquo;ll have gotten even better at that.</description>

      <description>This is my first rambling! These posts are meant to be informal, non-technical and low-quality short ramblings about me, my life, and what&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind lately.</description>
