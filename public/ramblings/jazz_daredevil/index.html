  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I was listening to Jon Benjamin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Well, I Should Have&hellip;&rdquo; the other day and got to thinking on why I like it so much. Every time I hear it I can&rsquo;t stop laughing, and not laughing because I think it&rsquo;s funny, I laugh because I think it&rsquo;s <em>fun</em>, and there&rsquo;s a big difference (I think).</p>
<h1 id="well-i-should-have">Well, I Should Have&hellip;</h1>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of this album, it&rsquo;s a jazz album starred by Jon Benjamin, an American voice actor, who just so happens to be a piano player that has no clue <em>whatsoever</em> how to play piano. He&rsquo;s accompanied by an actual jazz band with great musicians, which makes for some really interesting music. According to him, the band wasn&rsquo;t actually aware of the full situation going in, so when they realised they were playing with someone who literally had never touched a piano before, they got pretty mad. But not mad enough to not finish the album thankfully.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-i-like-it-so-much">Why do I like it so much?</h1>
<p>And that begs the question, why do I like it so much? Well, first of all, I don&rsquo;t hate the comedy bits sprinkled here or there, but I don&rsquo;t really care for them either. It may sound weird, but I actually, really, truly enjoy the music tracks in the album. It&rsquo;s such a fun, carefree sound that I haven&rsquo;t heard anywhere else, it reminds me of the childlike whimsical feeling of bashing away at my mom&rsquo;s piano, without caring about the end result. Jon&rsquo;s playing feels like that, like a child playing and having fun. And that&rsquo;s what I love about it. I love that it could literally be me playing the piano in those songs, and I just really like imagining that it really is me.</p>
<h1 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h1>
<p>You may be asking. The piano licks aren&rsquo;t great, and the timing is even worse, but I just can&rsquo;t not have fun eeverytime I hear it. I know this sounds cliche, but it&rsquo;s so easy to get caught up in out day-to-day life, stressing over work and tasks and deadlines and all that, being so serious about everything. And it&rsquo;s refreshing to remind myself that I don&rsquo;t have to take things too seriously, it&rsquo;s okay to do things for fun, to do things for the sake of doing. Even if they make me look ridiculous. Even if it turns out you are actually a worse pianist than a kid after his first piano lesson. Sometimes it&rsquo;s ok to suck at something and do it anyway. That&rsquo;s what children do, and they seem to me a lot happier than most adults I know.</p>
