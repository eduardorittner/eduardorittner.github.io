      <description>Dynamic programming is a scary name, but once you understand their general structure of these problems, they become much easier to solve. But first, what is dynamic programming? Dynamic programming is the discipline of solving combinatorial optimization problems as efficiently as possible, without having to calculate every possible solution. In technical terms, an optimal solution is any solution which maximizes (or minimizes) the target function (what we want to optmize). There is a 3 step process to solving any DP problem:</description>

      <description>Reading source code can be a great way to learn from those who have more experience, as well as see how the projects are structured, how functions are written, etc. So today we are going to be diving in the sds source code. Sds stands for simple dynamic strings, and it&amp;rsquo;s a three file library for dealing with dynamic strings in c, most notably, it&amp;rsquo;s used inside Redis for everything pertaining to strings.</description>

      <description>Yesterday my first ever PR to an open source project was accepted and commited, however, my contribution had (almost) nothing to do with code, but instead documentation, and I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly fine with that, here&amp;rsquo;s why.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m relatively new to programming, in fact, my journey into coding started less than 2 years ago, when I got into university and started my undergrad in computer science and engineering. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve had basically one coding discipline per semester (the first 2 years are kind of slow since I have to take a lot of engineering disciplines such as physics (1 to 4), a lot of maths and just a bit of chemistry).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m part of a junior company at my university where we design websites and web apps for small businesses. To keep everything neat and tidy, everyone gets an email account associated to the company (just like a company email minus the part where I get paid) to use all our tools such as figma for prototyping, google drive for file and document storage, and most importantly github for developing and maintaining projects.</description>
