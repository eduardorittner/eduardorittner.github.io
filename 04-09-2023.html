        <h1>TIL How to make a blog in Github Pages</h1>
        <p>
            This is the first blog post of (hopefully) many more to come where I gather what I've learned into byte-sized blog posts. This first one is going to be on how to set up a website on Github Pages. For those of you unaware, Github Pages allows you to host (mostly) static websites on a user or per project basis completely for free. The site files cannot be bigger than 1GB and can also use javascript and/or API calls to serve dynamic content. Another useful feature is that the process of publishing can be automated via Github Actions, for example every time changes are applied to a specific branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to be focusing on user sites (those that are tied to a specific github account), but most of the things here should apply to project sites as well. To start off you must create a new github repo with the name "username.github.io", then go into the repo settings, choose "Pages", under "Code and automation" and on the "Branch" option select "main" (or "master"), this determines where the site is built from.
        </p>
        <p>
            When serving you the website, Github Pages first looks for a file named "index.md", then "README.md", then "index.html", in that order. Since my goal in this was to learn a litte bit more about the basics of html and css, I created a "index.html" and went on my merry way. For anything more than a toy website (such as this one), you'll probably want to use an app or framework for generating the html, but in my case handcrafting each html file will do for now. You can add as many new html files and pages as you'd like with anchor tags, and css is easily integrated via the usual means of "link rel=..." in the document head.
        </p>
        <p>
        And that's it for now! you can view your website either through the "Pages" menu we accessed earlier or by going directly to https://username.github.io. Changes to the site take a bit longer than changes to the repo (usually 10 seconds or so), but if they take more than that the website may have been cached, to sort that out you need to hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Fn5 works for me). There are also some cases where only the html has updated while the css has not, the hard refresh should also fix things here.
