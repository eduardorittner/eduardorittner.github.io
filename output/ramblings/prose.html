        <p>I am always fascinated by niche programming languages. Not the ones that are useful, but those that are fun and interesting, like Nicole Tietz's <a href="https://hurl.wtf/">Hurl</a>, a language based entirely on exceptions. So the other day I was thinking, and what if there was a programming language that looked a lot like text.
For example, declaring variables would be using the <code>is</code> keyword, like <code>a is 1</code>. Comparison operators would be spelled out, like <code>greater than</code>, <code>less than</code> and <code>equal to</code>. Instead of <code>else if</code> and <code>else</code>, there would be <code>or if</code> and <code>if not</code>, or something like that. <code>say</code> instead of <code>print</code>, and every expression should be a line, and blocks start with <code>:</code> and end with <code>.</code>. A small program would then be something like:</p>
<pre><code>a is 0
while a is less than 100:
    say &quot;counter: &quot; a
    a is a + 1.
say &quot;a's final values is &quot; a
</code></pre>
<p>Just something I've been thinking about.The language itself would be a pretty simple stack based language, which is something I'm familiar with after having followed <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>. It would be cool to have something like pattern matching which could match both on concrete instances of types as well as generic ones, like:</p>
<pre><code>if a is
    | string &quot;hello&quot; -&gt; say &quot;a is hello&quot;.
    | number 1 -&gt; say &quot;a is 1&quot;.
    | bool true -&gt; say &quot;a is true&quot;.
    | bool false -&gt; say &quot;a is false&quot;.
    | number -&gt; say &quot;a is a number and a is not 1&quot;.
    | string -&gt; say &quot;a is a string and a is not \&quot;hello\&quot;&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>or something like that. I like that it looks a lot like pseudo-programming, and feels very similar as to how we would explaing things to someone.</p>
