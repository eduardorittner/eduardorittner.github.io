        <article id="post"><div class="stack"><h1>I'm 20!</h1><span class="date">Published: 2024-06-16</span></div><h3>Basically what the title says, I've just turned 20 years old, and this is what's on my mind.</h3>
<p>Stress runs in my family, and I am definetely guilty of worrying too much, too soon and too often about things. However, things have been looking up and I've found that lately I've gotten much better at not worrying unnecesseraly, and just having a good time even on weekdays, I hope that by the time I'm 21 I'll have gotten even better at that.</p>
<p>It's not nice to admit it but I've also been pretty lonely. My girlfriend's been there for me (like always) and my family as well, but I've grown apart from most of my friends, and have found it difficult to cultivate new friendships. So I hope that 21 year old me will have gotten some new friends (not a lot, just a few good ones) and also spent more time on hobbies far from computers and tech.</p>
<p>Last but not least I hope to be employed as an intern or junior at a nice job, somewhere where the work I do excites me and inspires me to learn more and become better at my craft.</p>
<p>I think that's all, life's been hard but it's also been good, and things are looking up I think. Who knows! Happy birthday to me.</p>
