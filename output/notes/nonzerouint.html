        <p>I recently discovered Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.NonZero.html">NonZero</a> types which are implemented for all ints and uints, and as the name implies are integers which are guaranteed to not be null. This may seem a bit silly, but this one guarantee is what enables <code>size_of::Option&lt;NonZero&lt;u8&gt;&gt;() == size_of::NonZero&lt;u8&gt;()</code>, which basically means that an Option of a NonZero integer has no additional cost compared to an integer. This is useful whenever 0 is used as a sentinel value, since it brings that information into the type system and increases robustness, given that now 0 is not a sentinel value with the same underlying type, but a different type altogether.</p>
